# ReputeHub v3 - Strategic Considerations & Risk Assessment

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the ReputeHub v3 proposal, this document outlines critical considerations for the AI Social Intelligence & Engagement System development. The analysis reveals significant technical and legal risks with the proposed social media scraping approach, while identifying a highly viable alternative path focusing on v1+v2 features.

## Key Finding: Social Media Scraping - Critical Risk Analysis

### The Core Problem

The v3 proposal's **"Social Media Scraping & Listening Agent"** presents the highest risk to project success:

**What v3 Proposes:**

> "Continuously collect brand mentions, hashtags, and posts/comments from social platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter/X)"

**Reality Check:**

- ❌ **Facebook/Instagram**: Graph API severely limited; scraping violates ToS
- ❌ **LinkedIn**: Actively blocks scrapers, legal action precedent
- ⚠️ **Twitter/X**: Enterprise API costs $100-42K/month
- 🔴 **Risk Level**: HIGH - Could halt entire project

### Technical Challenges with Scraping

| Platform  | Official API Limitations      | Scraping Risks                     | Cost Reality                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Facebook  | Only YOUR business page data  | ToS violation, account bans        | Free (limited)                 |
| Instagram | YOUR posts/comments only      | Bot detection, IP blocking         | Free (very limited)            |
| Twitter/X | Limited search, mentions only | Rate limiting, auth required       | $100-42K/month for full access |
| LinkedIn  | Company page analytics only   | Legal action risk, blocks scrapers | Highly restrictive             |

### Why Platforms Fight Scraping
