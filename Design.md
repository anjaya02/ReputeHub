> Buttons: [Cancel] [Logout]

Redirect → Login page.

---

## 9️⃣ **System-Level Error Handling & Edge Cases**

### 🔄 **Data Collection & Scheduler Edge Cases**

- **Apify Actor fails** → mark job status = "failed", retry after 10 minutes
- **Partial data fetched** (e.g., Facebook returns incomplete results) → flag in admin "Monitor Jobs"
- **Scheduler overlap** (previous run still processing) → queue next run, skip duplicates
- **Data older than 30 days** → automatically archived to optimize performance
- **API quota exhaustion** → defer execution and retry at next cycle

> _"If Apify fails twice consecutively for the same tenant, the system auto-notifies the admin dashboard under 'Job Alerts' with failure reason (proxy, API quota, etc.)."_

### 🔒 **Security & Access Edge Cases**

- **JWT expiry mid-session** → silent token refresh without user interruption
- **Invalid token** → logout and redirect to /login with session expired message
- **Admin tries to view unauthorized client** → "Access denied" banner with audit log
- **API input sanitization** → XSS, SQL injection prevention with input validation
- **Brute force protection** → progressive delays and account lockout
- **CSRF protection** → token validation for all state-changing operations

### 🌐 **Network & API Edge Cases**

- **Reddit API returns 429 (rate limit)** → scheduler defers execution for that platform only while others continue
- **Twilio delivery failure** → fallback to email notification with delivery confirmation
- **MongoDB connection loss** → automatic reconnection with circuit breaker pattern
- **Third-party API authentication errors** → admin alert with specific integration details
- **Network timeout** → exponential backoff retry mechanism

### 🎨 **UI/UX Error States**

- **Loading states** → skeleton loaders for all async operations
- **Empty state messages** → contextual illustrations and actionable guidance
- **Error boundaries** → "Something went wrong, please retry" with error reporting
- **Global 404 / 500 pages** → user-friendly with navigation back to dashboard
- **Toast notifications** → success/error feedback for all user actions
- **Offline mode** → graceful degradation with cached data display

### 📊 **Data Processing Edge Cases**

- **NLP model confidence < 60%** → display warning and allow manual override
- **Sentiment analysis failure** → fallback to keyword-based classification
- **Language detection issues** → default to English processing with confidence indicator
- **Duplicate content detection** → SHA-256 hash comparison for identical mentions
- **Invalid or corrupted data** → quarantine for manual review

### ⚡ **Performance & Scaling Edge Cases**

- **Database query timeout** → implement query optimization and indexing strategies
- **Memory usage spikes** → automatic garbage collection and resource monitoring
- **High concurrent users** → load balancing with session affinity
- **Large dataset exports** → chunked processing with progress indicators
- **Background job queue overflow** → priority-based job scheduling

---

**Error Handling and Edge Case Management Summary:**

> Reputify includes systematic error handling for both client and admin workflows. Each module supports fallback behaviors to ensure usability under network errors, data shortages, or third-party service failures. The scheduler includes automatic retries for failed Apify runs, UI elements display appropriate empty or error states, and AI modules gracefully degrade to default responses if NLP processing fails. Admin tools can monitor all failed jobs or API issues in real time under "Monitor Jobs." This proactive design prevents system downtime and ensures data consistency across refresh cycles.

## 1️⃣2️⃣ **AI Bot & NLP Intelligence Layer**

Reputify integrates an **AI-driven Reputation Assistant (R.AI)** — an intelligent bot that automates the understanding and response to customer feedback across multiple platforms. The AI layer enhances the platform by transforming raw textual mentions into actionable insights.

### **Core Functions of the AI Bot**

1. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   The bot classifies each mention or review into _positive, negative, or neutral_ categories with intensity scores using fine-tuned multilingual transformer models (Sinhala, Tamil, and English).

2. **Intent Detection:**
   Detects the purpose behind a user's comment — for example, _complaint, praise, question, or suggestion_ — improving prioritization accuracy in alerts.

3. **Aspect Extraction:**
   Identifies specific business areas (e.g., _service, pricing, delivery, staff behavior_) mentioned within feedback to provide detailed insights in the dashboard.

4. **AI Response Suggestion (Conversational Bot):**
   The AI Bot generates **context-aware suggested replies** for each customer comment using OpenAI's GPT-based model.

   - Example:
     _Input:_ "Service was very slow today."
     _AI Suggestion:_ "We're sorry for the delay! We value your feedback and are working to improve our service time."
   - Users can edit or approve suggestions before posting.
   - **AI Confidence Threshold**: AI replies below 60% confidence require manual approval to ensure quality and accuracy.

5. **Reputation Scoring Engine:**
   Aggregates sentiment trends, alert frequency, and response rate into a single **Reputation Index** (0–100) displayed on the dashboard.

6. **Multilingual NLP:**
   Handles trilingual content — Sinhala, Tamil, and English — ensuring cultural and linguistic inclusivity for the South Asian market.

### **Integration Flow**

- Data from Apify and official APIs → FastAPI Backend → **NLP Engine (AI Bot)**
- AI Bot performs sentiment, aspect, and intent analysis → returns structured JSON to MongoDB
- The dashboard and alerts system visualize and act on this AI-processed data

### **Ethical AI Usage**

- The AI bot operates transparently: all suggested replies are reviewed by users before publishing.
- No personal or private data is used for training or storage.
- The AI adheres to ethical use and regional privacy compliance.

### **Legal/Ethical Considerations**

> "Reputify uses Apify ethically to collect only publicly available data in compliance with privacy regulations. No private or user-restricted information is accessed."

**In summary:**
Reputify's AI Bot acts as the "brain" of the platform — continuously learning from user interactions and enabling businesses to respond intelligently and faster to customer sentiment.

Non-payment or cancellation pauses data collection and alerting features. A 7-day grace period allows reactivation without data loss. Data retention depends on plan type — 30 days for Starter, 90 days for Professional, and 180 days for Business — after which archived data is securely purged.

**Data Retention Policy:**

- Starter Plan: 30 days
- Professional Plan: 90 days
- Business Plan: 180 days
  After the retention period, older mentions and reports are automatically deleted or archived.

### **Competitive Advantage**

- **10× cheaper** than international competitors (Brand24 / Mention.com)
- **Multilingual AI engine** (Sinhala/Tamil/English)
- **Localized support** and data compliance for South Asia
- **Regional payment methods** and currency support

**In summary:**
Reputify's pricing structure ensures accessibility for small businesses while scaling with enterprise needs, creating a sustainable and competitive SaaS model.

- **Section 2 (Wireframe Table)** = Your component checklist
- **Edge Cases sections** = Your error state designs

**Step 3: Priority Order for Wireframes**

1. **Dashboard** (most complex, sets design language)
2. **Mentions Feed** (core user workflow)
3. **Login/Landing** (user entry points)
4. **Mention Details** (detail page pattern)
5. **Settings/Admin** (configuration pages)

### 🎨 **Phase 2: Component Specifications**

**Essential UI Components to Design:**

| Component Type   | Specific Elements                    | Reference Section |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Navigation**   | Top nav, sidebar menu, breadcrumbs   | Dashboard spec    |
| **Data Display** | KPI cards, mention cards, tables     | All page specs    |
| **Charts**       | Line graphs, pie charts, bar charts  | Reports spec      |
| **Forms**        | Login, filters, settings             | Multiple specs    |
| **Feedback**     | Toasts, modals, loading states       | Edge cases        |
| **Empty States** | No data illustrations, retry buttons | Edge cases        |

---

### 📋 **Phase 3: Wireframe Checklist**

**For Each Page, Design:**

- ✅ **Normal state** (with data populated)
- ✅ **Loading state** (skeleton loaders)
- ✅ **Empty state** (no data message)
- ✅ **Error state** (failure + retry option)
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** (375px breakpoint)

**Example: Dashboard Page Wireframes Needed**

- Dashboard with full data ✅
- Dashboard loading (skeleton) ✅
- Dashboard empty (new account) ✅
- Dashboard error (API failure) ✅
- Dashboard mobile layout ✅

---

### 🚀 **UI Team Success Metrics**

**When wireframes are complete, you should have:**

- 📱 **55+ wireframe screens** (11 pages × 5 states each)
- 🎨 **Consistent component library** (buttons, cards, forms)
- 📊 **All chart/graph layouts** defined
- 🔄 **Complete user flows** from landing to dashboard
- 📱 **Mobile-responsive** versions

**Your design system will be production-ready when developers can:**

1. Build any page without asking "What should this look like?"
2. Handle all error cases with pre-designed UI states
3. Implement responsive layouts following your breakpoints

---

### 💡 **Pro Tips for Your Designers**

1. **Start with Dashboard** - it's the most complex and sets your design language
2. **Design mobile-first** - easier to scale up than down
3. **Create error states early** - they're often forgotten until testing
4. **Use real data** - "Lorem ipsum" hides UX problems
5. **Test empty states** - new users see these first

---

**🎯 Result: Your UI team now has everything needed to create production-ready wireframes without any guesswork!**

---

## **Testing & Quality Assurance**

Unit and integration testing are conducted using Jest (frontend) and Pytest (backend) to ensure reliability of NLP, data ingestion, and alert triggers.
