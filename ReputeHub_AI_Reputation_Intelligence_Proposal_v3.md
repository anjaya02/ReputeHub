## 1. The Problem: Digital Reputation Blind Spots

Small and medium businesses often face the same critical challenge — **they don’t know what customers are saying about them until it’s too late.**

### Common Problems:

- ⏰ **Time Constraints:** Owners can’t monitor reviews across platforms daily.
- ⚠️ **Unnoticed Negative Feedback:** Damaging comments go unanswered.
- 🧩 **Scattered Data:** Google, Facebook, and TripAdvisor reviews aren’t connected.
- 🔍 **Lack of Insights:** No clear way to know _why_ ratings drop.
- 🔕 **Reactive Management:** Issues are discovered only after customers leave.

### Business Impact:

- Loss of trust, customers, and revenue due to unmanaged online perception.
