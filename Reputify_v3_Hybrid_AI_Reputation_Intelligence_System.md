## 5. **Detailed Feature Breakdown**

### üß© **v1 ‚Äì Core Modules (Foundation)**

#### 1. **Multi-Platform Review Integration**

**Purpose:** Aggregate customer reviews and mentions from all key platforms using a comprehensive hybrid approach.  
**Data Collection Strategy:**

**üîå Official API Integration (Primary Sources):**

- Google Business Profile API ‚Üí Reviews & Ratings
- YouTube Data API ‚Üí Comments & Community Posts
- Reddit API ‚Üí Mentions & Discussions
- Facebook Graph API ‚Üí Client's own Facebook Page (reviews, comments, posts)

**ü§ñ Apify Automation (Secondary Sources):**

- Facebook Public Mentions Scraper ‚Üí Public posts mentioning business (hashtags, brand mentions)
- LinkedIn Company Page Scraper ‚Üí Public company mentions and hashtags

**How It Works:**

- üîÑ **APIs:** Fetch structured data every 15 minutes using official APIs for Google Business, YouTube, Reddit, and client's own Facebook Pages.
- ü§ñ **Facebook Hybrid:** Uses Graph API for client's own page data (free) + Apify for public mentions/hashtags (paid per run).
- üï∏Ô∏è **LinkedIn Apify:** Collects publicly available company mentions via compliant automation that manages proxies, rate limits, and platform restrictions.
- üóÇÔ∏è Stores unified data with timestamps, ratings, sentiment, and source platform.
- üìã Single dashboard shows all reviews and mentions in one consolidated view.

**Example:**

> A caf√© receives a new 2‚≠ê review on Google, a comment on their own Facebook page, and a public Facebook post saying "Great coffee at [Business Name] but service was slow." All three appear instantly on the unified dashboard with source attribution and cost-optimized data collection.

---

#### **1.1 Facebook Hybrid Data Collection Strategy**

**Purpose:** Optimize Facebook data collection through a dual-approach model that balances cost efficiency with comprehensive coverage.

**The Two Facebook Data Sources:**

| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Client's Own Facebook Page** | ‚úÖ Facebook Graph API | üí∞ **Free**         | Reviews, comments, posts, page ratings   |
| **Public Brand Mentions**      | ‚öôÔ∏è Apify Automation   | üí∏ **Paid per run** | Hashtags, brand mentions in public posts |

**Technical Implementation:**
