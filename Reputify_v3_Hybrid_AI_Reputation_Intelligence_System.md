## 5. **Detailed Feature Breakdown**

### 🧩 **v1 – Core Modules (Foundation)**

#### 1. **Multi-Platform Review Integration**

**Purpose:** Aggregate customer reviews and mentions from all key platforms using a comprehensive hybrid approach.  
**Data Collection Strategy:**

**🔌 Official API Integration (Primary Sources):**

- Google Business Profile API → Reviews & Ratings
- YouTube Data API → Comments & Community Posts
- Reddit API → Mentions & Discussions
- Facebook Graph API → Client's own Facebook Page (reviews, comments, posts)

**🤖 Apify Automation (Secondary Sources):**

- Facebook Public Mentions Scraper → Public posts mentioning business (hashtags, brand mentions)
- LinkedIn Company Page Scraper → Public company mentions and hashtags

**How It Works:**

- 🔄 **APIs:** Fetch structured data every 15 minutes using official APIs for Google Business, YouTube, Reddit, and client's own Facebook Pages.
- 🤖 **Facebook Hybrid:** Uses Graph API for client's own page data (free) + Apify for public mentions/hashtags (paid per run).
- 🕸️ **LinkedIn Apify:** Collects publicly available company mentions via compliant automation that manages proxies, rate limits, and platform restrictions.
- 🗂️ Stores unified data with timestamps, ratings, sentiment, and source platform.
- 📋 Single dashboard shows all reviews and mentions in one consolidated view.

**Example:**

> A café receives a new 2⭐ review on Google, a comment on their own Facebook page, and a public Facebook post saying "Great coffee at [Business Name] but service was slow." All three appear instantly on the unified dashboard with source attribution and cost-optimized data collection.

---

#### **1.1 Facebook Hybrid Data Collection Strategy**

**Purpose:** Optimize Facebook data collection through a dual-approach model that balances cost efficiency with comprehensive coverage.

**The Two Facebook Data Sources:**

| Data Source                    | Access Method         | Cost                | Coverage                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Client's Own Facebook Page** | ✅ Facebook Graph API | 💰 **Free**         | Reviews, comments, posts, page ratings   |
| **Public Brand Mentions**      | ⚙️ Apify Automation   | 💸 **Paid per run** | Hashtags, brand mentions in public posts |

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Graph API Integration:** OAuth-based connection allowing clients to grant page access tokens for their own Facebook pages.
- **Apify Public Scraping:** Compliant automation for public mentions and hashtag tracking across the broader Facebook network.
- **Cost Optimization:** Up to 70-80% reduction in automation costs by using free Graph API for owned page data.
- **Unified Pipeline:** Both data sources feed into the same MongoDB collection with source attribution.

**Client Experience:**

- **Integrations Page:** Separate options for "Connect Facebook Page" (Graph API) and "Track Public Mentions" (Apify).
- **Dashboard Clarity:** Clear indication of data source (Own Page vs. Public Mentions) for transparency.
- **Pricing Transparency:** Public mention tracking available as premium feature under Professional/Business plans.

**Example Workflow:**

> Restaurant owner connects their Facebook page via Graph API (free). System automatically retrieves all page reviews and comments. Optionally, they enable "Public Mentions" tracking to monitor when customers mention their restaurant in personal posts or food groups (Apify-based, included in Professional plan).

---

#### 2. **Basic Sentiment Classification**

> Output: 🍴 Food = Positive (0.88), 🕒 Service = Negative (0.73)

---

#### 3. **AI Response Generator (Human-Approved)**

**Purpose:** Generate empathetic, context-aware replies in local languages.  
**Languages:** Sinhala, Tamil, English.  
**Safety:** All replies require manual approval before posting.

---

#### 5. **Smart Alert System**

**Purpose:** Notify owners immediately about critical feedback.  
**Triggers:**

- 1⭐/2⭐ reviews
- 📉 Sentiment spikes
- Keywords: “refund”, “complaint”, “bad service”

---

### 🧠 **v2 – Smart Intelligence Modules**

#### 6. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**

**Purpose:** Understand sentiment for specific aspects (Service, Price, Cleanliness, etc.).  
**Tech:** Fine-tuned BERT/XLM-RoBERTa models.

> Output → Food: Positive (0.91), Service: Negative (0.78)

---

#### 7. **Predictive Reputation Analytics**

**Purpose:** Forecast rating trends for the next 1–3 months.  
**Tech:** Prophet/LSTM time-series forecasting.

**Example:**

---

#### 8. **Review Plausibility Analysis**

**Purpose:** Assess the credibility and authenticity patterns of reviews.  
**Features:**

- Detect repetitive text patterns
- Identify unusual account behaviors
- Plausibility confidence score

**Example:**

> "Identical 1⭐ reviews from new accounts → Low plausibility (15% confidence)."

---

---

#### 11. **Conversational AI Engagement Bot (with Oversight)**

**Purpose:** Suggest empathetic, pre-approved replies to customer complaints or queries.  
**Safety:** Human review before posting.  
**Example:**

> User: “Terrible service yesterday!”

---

#### 12. **Issue Extraction & Reporting Engine**

**Purpose:** Automatically group similar complaints into categories.  
**Example Output:**

**Purpose:** Monitor the public reputation of key competitors.  
**Features:**

- Track average rating changes for up to 3 competitors.
- Compare review volume and sentiment trends.
- Identify competitor weaknesses to turn into opportunities.

**Example:**

> A café notices a rival’s sentiment for “coffee quality” is dropping, so they launch a marketing campaign focused on their premium beans.
